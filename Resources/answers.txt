I believe that with my skills I will be a great addition to the team. Through my internship, I have also worked in teams before therefore I think that I will be able to adjust very easily.

Ever since I was young I have always been interested in gaming, especially rpg games and other character-interaction games so my dream has always been to develop my own game.

# Responsible
In my last position, I was responsible for reviewing, verifying and filing all customer records. This included using software systems to ensure all data information was correct for each customer. I was also responsible for notifying my supervisor if there were any discrepancies noted in a customer's record. My attention to detail skills helped reduce record discrepancies.
Firstly, I would try to contact them. Then, I add a few of their responsibilities to each person working. This would ensure everyone helped contribute to completing the additional tasks and that there wasn't one person completing all the tasks. This would help maintain the productivity levels during the day and help prevent added stress on the team.
When I was starting in my previous role, I was in charge of creating new customer accounts in the computer database. I wasn't familiar with the system yet and did not ask for help to open a new client account. I ended up opening the account with a few errors which setback the customer's ability to access their account. I quickly realized my mistake and asked my supervisor for help to fix the situation. They resolved the setback and I asked for clarification on the correct process to open customer accounts.
In my previous role as a project coordinator, I had tasks and projects with multiple different priorities. To help me manage each project effectively, I made a spreadsheet that organized each task according to priority and deadlines. This helped me keep track of each task and reorganize them based on changing priority levels. This method helped me to deliver all my projects before each of their respective deadlines.
Once I am familiar with the role, I am comfortable handling tasks and projects on my own. My previous role in customer service helped me balance working independently and collaborating with a team to ensure we completed all daily tasks each shift.
