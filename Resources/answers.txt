I graduated from University of Toronto 2 years ago, I then went travelling around the world, in my travels I ended up interning at a tech company for one year in Malaysia where I worked on projects with other team members.

I believe that with my skills I will be a great addition to the team. Through my internship, I have also worked in teams before therefore I think that I will be able to adjust very easily.

Ever since I was young I have always been interested in gaming, especially rpg games and other character-interaction games so my dream has always been to develop my own game.

# Responsible
In my last position, I was responsible for reviewing, verifying and filing all customer records. This included using software systems to ensure all data information was correct for each customer. I was also responsible for notifying my supervisor if there were any discrepancies noted in a customer's record. My attention to detail skills helped reduce record discrepancies.
Firstly, I would try to contact them. Then, I add a few of their responsibilities to each person working. This would ensure everyone helped contribute to completing the additional tasks and that there wasn't one person completing all the tasks. This would help maintain the productivity levels during the day and help prevent added stress on the team.
When I was starting in my previous role, I was in charge of creating new customer accounts in the computer database. I wasn't familiar with the system yet and did not ask for help to open a new client account. I ended up opening the account with a few errors which setback the customer's ability to access their account. I quickly realized my mistake and asked my supervisor for help to fix the situation. They resolved the setback and I asked for clarification on the correct process to open customer accounts.
In my previous role as a project coordinator, I had tasks and projects with multiple different priorities. To help me manage each project effectively, I made a spreadsheet that organized each task according to priority and deadlines. This helped me keep track of each task and reorganize them based on changing priority levels. This method helped me to deliver all my projects before each of their respective deadlines.
Once I am familiar with the role, I am comfortable handling tasks and projects on my own. My previous role in customer service helped me balance working independently and collaborating with a team to ensure we completed all daily tasks each shift.

# Creativity
To me, innovation means to think unconventionally, to allow thoughts to formulate without interruption and then to challenge the status quo to think more of why not vs why and to allow open communication between members to share ideas and think creatively with no judgment.

# Artistic
I've developed my career as an art instructor by doing commissions for custom ink drawings and working as a preschool teaching assistant. Each of these experiences and practices allowed me to become a better and more patient artist who can connect deeply with those attending my classes and teach them the basics of pen and ink drawing.
I love collaborating with artists like dancers and musicians when I have a gallery show because these mutually beneficial projects give audience members a deeper understanding of our art. When a gallery allows it, I present many of my sculptures with accompanying performative dance and music from various genres to set the mood and tell a deeper story. Lately, I've been collaborating with a local dance company to create a series of sculptures based on their dancers and help create choreography to present with my pieces.
My best piece of art is a ceramic tea set that took me months to perfect as I studied classic tea-set shapes worldwide and combined them to represent my cultural heritage. The teapot, each cup and each dish are white clay formed on a kiln and by hand, and the pieces all show a roundness from far away that matches well with the smooth, shiny glaze. I also colored each piece in pale blue and dark orange to represent my contrasting heritage, which increases visual interest.
My dream art project would be if I could work on a community-designed mural to display on a building in town. Being able to connect with people in my community and show the diversity of ideas and cultures to visitors would be fulfilling and challenging, but I would greatly enjoy it. I also love working outdoors, so a project like that would make me very happy.
Yes, but not because I paint. I am a good artist because of my ability to transform the obvious from invisible to prominent through my expressed observations, which I may or may not choose to communicate in a visual image.

# Patience
I can't say, but I have received this feedback often from colleagues, who consider me really patient. I would rate myself a seven or an 8 out of 10 because I know that there is always room for improvement. In general, I must stay professional and provide the best service possible to my colleagues, and this helps me to stay focus on the task at hand. In the end, the satisfaction to see your customer happy is worth being patient, at least for me.
Six months ago, I processed a customer's book order over the phone and ordered the wrong title because of a miscommunication. They called back a week later to express their frustration, as this book was a birthday gift for their son and might be late because of the error. I listened to her explanation patiently and asked clarifying questions to better assess how the miscommunication occurred. After I discovered she requested the second book in the series instead of the first, I explained the circumstances and ensured we ordered the correct title.
One example of a time when I had to explain something complicated happened with a potential customer. The organization I worked for provided web design and site hosting. One small business owner didn't understand how a network connection worked. I explained the process of how a personal computer got information from the network. I broke down the steps that the computer and network went through during communication. Then- I drew a diagram on a whiteboard and labeled everything to make it clearer. The result of this was that the business realized that it was worthwhile to invest in a dedicated broadband internet connection for the company- and my organization gained a new client.
I found it extremely difficult to work with a financial analyst in my last job. It was pivotal that they delivered their reports on time, and as early as possible, so we in the sales department could make the right decisions on each given day. But the analyst was a laid back guy. They were precise, they rarely made mistakes, just they did not do the job quick enough. After calmly explaining them a couple of times why we needed their analyses in the shortest possible time, and not being heard out, I got angry and sad some bad words in their direction, which I something I regret up to this point. Eventually I raised the issue with their superior, which was a more sensible solution, and the situation improved somehow. I still found it difficult to get along with them, but at least I managed to keep it professional, and did not start any other conflicts.
On my recent internship, we had an all-hands-on-deck request when one of the customers put in an unexpectedly large order which needed to be fulfilled within 24 hours. Our team mobilized to assist in fulfilling the order and literally worked around the clock to make it happen. I learned a great deal about exceeding customer expectations during that time and our team also worked out a process document covering our lessons learned so that this type of situation could be handled more efficiently in the future

# Analytical
I always develop detailed plans for both tasks and projects because I've noticed that I'm more productive when I do. By having a procedure to follow, I know exactly what I need to work on and when tasks are due. Detailed plans ensure I produce accurate and high-quality work. I always keep up with innovation and recent research, so I'm comfortable adjusting my plans if something else works better or creates better results.
I have made errors at work when analyzing a situation. In my previous roles, I worked with budgets and budget analysis. I needed to consider both internal and external factors when analyzing the company's financial situation. One time, I made a budget analysis for a large project and I forgot to account for the marketing department's social media advertisements. When I calculated the numbers, I knew immediately that something was wrong, and I reviewed the budgets of every department before making a new assessment.
Most of the time, I make decisions depending on my team's risk analysis. Most recently, my supervisor asked my team to solve an issue with the company's website. Our contact page wasn't loading properly. We rarely changed or adjust processes, but there was an issue with the code that was interfering with loading pages. I spoke to my manager about the issue when I saw it. We typically had to run tests on the website and its pages before making a change. However, we needed to fix this essential web page as quickly as possible, so I took a calculated risk with my manager's permission. Fortunately, the risk was worth it and fixed our webpage.
When troubleshooting an issue, I want to understand the background of the problem. From here, I can look through each step of the problem and determine where it started. If there was an obvious misstep, it's typically a simple fix. In other situations, I try fixing the problem by testing out different solutions on several steps. This is typically sufficient to finding the route of the issue. If it doesn't reveal the error, I backtrack again, or I discuss the issue with my managers.
I was tracking vast amounts of data on spreadsheets. At certain times, I was doing a manual count of information on the spreadsheet but I knew there had to be a better way. On my own time, I started doing online tutorials to improve my knowledge of the program and I learned how to sort and review data more efficiently. It was like night and day. Something that had taken me about 5 or 6 hours to do, now took 1 or 2 hours.
