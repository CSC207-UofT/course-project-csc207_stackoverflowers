I believe that with my skills I will be a great addition to the team. Through my internship, I have also worked in teams before therefore I think that I will be able to adjust very easily.

Ever since I was young I have always been interested in gaming, especially rpg games and other character-interaction games so my dream has always been to develop my own game.

Yes I played team sports for about 10 years. I mainly played football and volleyball which taught me a lot of patience, teamwork and endurance.
I try to study minimum 4 hours a day, but usually it turns into 6 to 8.
I try to do all my work in time, so I have not pulled many all-nighters but the longest was about 48 hours.

Yes, I believe I have an adequate level oif endurance compared to most of my peers. I think I can work for longs hours at a time.
I think I have a good eye for observation and usually can adapt well to my surroundings.
I'm usually a very tranquil person, and so I have never obsessed about changes in my surroundings.
I was put in a new group for a project halfway through the semester, so I made sure to set aside extra time to get to know the other members.
Very well, I think most people have unique personalities, after all it is what makes us... well us! Besides, I wouldn't be fit for this position if I weren't.
I believe I am adaptable because I am ready to compromise and break patterns, to push myself when my circumstances change.
There was hostility among team members as they felt that one member was not pulling their weight. So I privately consulted the member to discuss the situation with them.
Yes, I am uniquely talented in understanding subtle facial expressions and thus, I can quickly react to any ongoing troubles.
I make sure to write tests as soon as I write any method.What methods do you use to check for bugs in your code?
I make sure to change my test cases as I go so any changes in my methods is reflected on my test cases, so I can always spot any minor errors.
Yes I am, I like to be aware of my surroundings, and I can easy spot small changes in the environment in a moments notice.
There was an altercation between two classmates, and I was able to connect with them and assist them in resolving their issues.
Two teammates had a very huge argument, and so I talked to both individually to act as a middleman.
I would try to show them prove and provide them with examples on why I think they are wrong
I had to make a presentation infant of my class. I think it went well because I prepared and organised my work well and I got positive feedback from my lecturer and class-mates.
Yes I think I am a good communicator as many of my peers have told me so.










# Responsible
In my last position, I was responsible for reviewing, verifying and filing all customer records. This included using software systems to ensure all data information was correct for each customer. I was also responsible for notifying my supervisor if there were any discrepancies noted in a customer's record. My attention to detail skills helped reduce record discrepancies.
Firstly, I would try to contact them. Then, I add a few of their responsibilities to each person working. This would ensure everyone helped contribute to completing the additional tasks and that there wasn't one person completing all the tasks. This would help maintain the productivity levels during the day and help prevent added stress on the team.
When I was starting in my previous role, I was in charge of creating new customer accounts in the computer database. I wasn't familiar with the system yet and did not ask for help to open a new client account. I ended up opening the account with a few errors which setback the customer's ability to access their account. I quickly realized my mistake and asked my supervisor for help to fix the situation. They resolved the setback and I asked for clarification on the correct process to open customer accounts.
In my previous role as a project coordinator, I had tasks and projects with multiple different priorities. To help me manage each project effectively, I made a spreadsheet that organized each task according to priority and deadlines. This helped me keep track of each task and reorganize them based on changing priority levels. This method helped me to deliver all my projects before each of their respective deadlines.
Once I am familiar with the role, I am comfortable handling tasks and projects on my own. My previous role in customer service helped me balance working independently and collaborating with a team to ensure we completed all daily tasks each shift.
