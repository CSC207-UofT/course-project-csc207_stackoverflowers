Hello! My name is [intern_name] 
	A: let's get started with the interview, why should we hire you?
	I'm a fast worker and a great cook! ;)

		A: you're hired!
		// would you like to hire this candidate? not part of tree, this should be from prompt maybe?

		B: next candidate!
		// are you sure you would like to move onto the next candidate? You will not be able to re-interview this
		candidate

	B: Nice to meet you, tell me a little about yourself. 
	I'm [intern_age] years old. I graduated from UofT 2 years ago and then travelled the 
	world to find inner peace.

		A: ...did you find it?
		No. 
			A: next candidate!
			// are you sure you would like to move onto the next candidate? You will not be able to re-interview this
			candidate

			B: That's unfortunate, I hope you can find inner peace in this company 
			instead. You're hired!
			// would you like to hire this candidate? are you sure? maybe not part of tree,
			this should be from prompt i think?

		B: What skills did you gain from your travels? 
		I learned creativity, flexibility and confidence.

			A: Not good enough, next candidate!
			// are you sure you would like to move onto the next candidate? You will not be able to re-interview
			this candidate

			B: you're hired!
			// would you like to hire this candidate? are you sure? maybe not part of tree,
            			this should be from prompt i think?
