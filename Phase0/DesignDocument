• Specification:
    This is the specification for our group project:
    Name of game: HR manager simulator

    - Structure/layer:
        - Entities: Entities.GamePrompts, UseCases.HRSystem, Entities.Intern, Entities.Project
        - Use cases: UseCases.GameMaker, UseCases.InterviewMaker, MonthMaker, ReportMaker
        - Controllers and Presenters: ControllersPresenters.GameManager, InterviewLevel, InterviewPresenter, Level, MonthLevel, MonthPresenter,
          ControllersPresenters.Presenter, ReportLevel, ReportPresenter
        - UI: Iphase, Mphase, RPhase, SPhase

    - Running the project will start a shell that prompts the user to enter their name.
        - Every time the game is first started, new interns are randomly generated and new projects are generated for the player.
        - the player will see the new interns that they must interview
        - the player will be able to check the intern information such as their skills and age

    - While running the game, we have some game prompts:
        - quit - quit the game
        - restart - restarts the whole game with new interns and new projects
        - all the game prompts will be stored in the Entities.GamePrompts class


    - The game will be comprised of 3 levels.
    - In the Interview level, the player will be able to interview the interns,
        - the interns will have automated responses to the interview question and the player will also be able to
          pick their own responses which will determine how the interview level progresses.
        - the player will be able to choose if they will hire the intern after each interview
        - the hired interns will be put in the company HR system
        - Therefore, the ‘hired’ list in the UseCases.HRSystem must be updated to reflect the player’s choices.

    - In the project level, the player will be able to assign interns to projects
        - based on the description and requirements of the project, the player will be able to check the intern skills and
          assign interns to projects

    - In the monthlyProgress level, the monthly report will show how each project is progressing
        - monthly report will show each project and the interns assigned to it and their progress
        - will show any irregularities that occur during the months ( intern on sick leave, intern failed task etc)
        - month is referred to as a stage in the game, not a specific date
        - the course of the game runs for 6 months, therefore each ‘month’ is just consider a period of the time
          for the game to progress
