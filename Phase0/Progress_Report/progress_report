Progress report for group stackoverflowers: 

- once the project phase 0 started, Mary and Farzana worked together to develop a visual overview of what the whole project would look like 
including possible interfaces and abstract classes to present to the group. 

- the project group then had a meeting where Mary presented the overview and the group members were able to decide which classes were important 
and which classes we could merge instead. 

- After the group had finalised the overview and the CRC card structure, Mary and Jacob wrote out the CRC cards and pushed it to the repository. 
Farzana, Camille, Maggie and Enam started on the scenario walkthrough and the skeleton program. 

- Maggie, Enam, Camille and Farzana decided on what classes and methods we would need to implement for the skeleton program with the help of Mary.

- Farzana wrote a draft specification and scenario walkthrough and pushed it to the repository. 

- Mary, Farzana and Maggie then met and wrote method signatures, TODOs and descriptions for the whole team to implement. 

- Mary, Maggie and Farzana implemented classes SPhase, GameMaker, GameManager

- Camille will implement class Intern and GamePrompts 

- Enam will implement class HRSystem 

- Jacob will finalise the specification.
