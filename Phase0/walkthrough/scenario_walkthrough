This is the scenario_walkthrough: 
Provide a written explanation (no more than 1-2 paragraphs) of a typical scenario walk-through for your CRC model. 
Try to choose a scenario that will really demonstrate to your TA that your model is doing a good job satisfying your
specification!
This will also help you better visualize how your program might look like once you start coding.

Scenario walkthrough:
In this scenario, the player first starts the game (when SPhase is running) and SPhase creates a GameManager.
When GameManager is initialized, it creates a new GameMaker.
When GameMaker is initialized, it creates an HRsystem and GamePrompts needed for the game.(the actual prompts of the game
 are stored in it as instances.) It also generates the three sample candidates (for the skeleton program) and stores them
 as a list. GameMaker then asks HRSystem to store this list of interns.

SPhase then asks GamePrompts for the ask-for-name prompt and presents it to the player. The player’s name is then stored
 in HRSystem.
Then, SPhase takes the User’s input and asks GameManager for the first prompt.
GameManager will then ask GameMaker to construct the first prompt with the player’s input.

GameMaker will use prompts in GamePrompts to construct the greeting part of the prompt, and then it will ask HRSystem to
 make the list of interns into a prompt. HRSystem will do so by asking the Intern Class to make each intern into a string,
 and format that. Then, GameMaker collects and returns the prompt to GameManager, which then returns it to SPhase for it
 to output to the player.

The output welcomes the player to the game along with the interns and their age and skills(from HRsystem).
These are candidates the player will interview in their first level of the game in class InterviewPhase (not implemented yet).
