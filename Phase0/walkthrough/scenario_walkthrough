This is the scenario_walkthrough: 
Provide a written explanation (no more than 1-2 paragraphs) of a typical scenario walk-through for your CRC model. 
Try to choose a scenario that will really demonstrate to your TA that your model is doing a good job satisfying your
specification!
This will also help you better visualize how your program might look like once you start coding.

Scenario walkthrough:
In this scenario, the player first starts the game (when SPhase is running) and SPhase creates a ControllersPresenters.GameManager.
When ControllersPresenters.GameManager is initialized, it creates a new UseCases.GameMaker.
When UseCases.GameMaker is initialized, it creates an HRsystem and Entities.GamePrompts needed for the game (the actual
prompts of the game are stored in it as instances). It also generates the three sample candidates (for the skeleton program)
 and stores them as a list in UseCases.HRSystem. SPhase then asks Entities.GamePrompts for the ask-for-name prompt and
 presents it to the player. The player’s name is then stored in UseCases.HRSystem. Then, SPhase takes the User’s input
 and asks ControllersPresenters.GameManager for the first prompt. ControllersPresenters.GameManager will then ask
 UseCases.GameMaker to construct the first prompt with the player’s input.

UseCases.GameMaker will use prompts in Entities.GamePrompts to construct the greeting part of the prompt, and then it will
ask UseCases.HRSystem to make the list of interns into a prompt. UseCases.HRSystem will do so by asking the Entities.Intern Class
 to make each intern into a string, and format that. Then, UseCases.GameMaker collects and returns the prompt to
 ControllersPresenters.GameManager, which then returns it to SPhase for it to output to the player.The output welcomes
 the player to the game along with the interns and their age and skills(from HRsystem). These are candidates the player
 will interview in their first level of the game in class InterviewPhase (not implemented yet).
