This is the specification for our group project: 

As an HR manager, you get a few candidates.
You can interview, and choose which interns you want on your team. 
After each interview, the player must decide right after each interview if they will hire the intern. 
Therefore, the ‘hired’ list in the HRsystem must be updated to reflect the player’s choices. 
HR can work with more than just interns, (employees that already are in the company or more) 
Interview interaction tree (of responses and results) - similar to a dating simulator where your responses determine a ‘good’ ending vs ‘bad ending’ (good ending being you hire the right intern, bad ending being you lose a potential intern etc) 
You can view the strengths, the resumes, cover letters and other info of the intern.
Then you are assigned a few projects by the company,which you have to assign appropriate interns to finish.
Project report: The result of the interns assigned to the projects will result in diff aspects of the project: the success/fail, the money this project brought to the company,, and others
