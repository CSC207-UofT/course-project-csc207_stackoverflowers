# Farzana: 
My role during Phase 2 was to work on ResponseTreeMaker with Camille and Maggie. We talked through the structure, wrote up new text files for the tree, and created a new algorithm together which helped Camille 
in implementing the code. I also worked on editing our code as the week went by, for example I changed the code so that classes InterviewLevel, InterviewMaker and HRSystem would recognize both 
uppercase and lowercase A or B input from player. I also worked on editing minor issues we had in the code for ResponseTreeMaker. I also wrote up most of the aspects for our Design Document and Specification 
for phase 2. 

Significant pull request: I was responsible for creating UseCase class GameGenerators and I think this was significant because it helped our code in following the SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE. (see pull request
12: https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-csc207_stackoverflowers/pull/12).

# Camille:
During Phase 2, I mainly worked on fixing ResponseTreeMaker with Maggie and Farzana. We created new questions and answers, and assigned corresponding skills for them
so that each intern would have a unique ResponseTree generated based on their skills. I implemented most of the helper methods in the class, and we all worked on figuring
out how to generate the ResponseTrees together. I also wrote up a few tests for the helper methods in ResponseTreeMakerTest, but I commented
them out since they are private methods. I also worked on our Design document.

Significant pull request: I added the new changes to ResponseTreeMaker https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-csc207_stackoverflowers/pull/97
