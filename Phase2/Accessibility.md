##Project Accessibility Report
2. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle.
   1. Equitable Use:\
      Our game is equally open for everyone to use. When generating interns, we also are very careful as to how to generate the interns so that they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. We treat all users the same: since the only information we require personally from the user is their name(to be used when saving the game). Thus our games aims provide the same experience for all players that want to play.
   
   2. Flexibility in Use:\
      For now, our game doesn't really allow the accomodation of multiple ways of use, but this could be implemented in the future by simply creating different interfaces(visual, audio included) to make the game be played on different platform, devices, and people. We allow error for the player's input, which is also discussed in Universal Design Principle 5: Tolerance for error.
   
   3. Simple and Intuitive Use: \
      To make sure that our game was simple and intuitive, we tried to make the game prompts as simple as possible to give direct instructions as to what the player can do next. Using prompts such as "type anything to continue" or "here are a list of commands that you can do" helps us ensure that the user will give correct prompts needed. Also, we tried to make our Error messages in Exception as precise as possible: as they can give the user the suggestion as to how to change their input so that they can play the game with guidance.
   
   4. Perceptible Information\
      To make sure that our Game could showcase the most important information to the players, we spend some time trying to make the our presented output well formatted. Since we are using a textual representation of how the game is going, we needed to pay special attention to how our game would display different parts of the game. We used the newline character very often, and also bullet points to section out the large information output. 
   
   5. Tolerance for Error:\
      Since we need accurate commands, we included an exception system that is quite strict as to how the inputs can be put. However, the player is allowed to type as many times as they want until they are able to type in a correct command. We also accomodate the player by providing our own exception messages, that might remind the player as to how their input doesn't match.
   
      Also to tolerate for accidental quits of the game, our code is now designed to save and quit at the same time, to make sure that the user doesn't accidentally quit a game.
   6. Low Physical Effort:\
      To try to make our game low physical effort, we tried to minimize the number of inputs that the player types in. For example when the player is interacting with the intern during the interview, instead of asking the player to type the entire sentence, we give the player the choice to type A or B, to minimize the physical effort they need to spend typing.
   
      To make our code more accountable for lowering physical effort in the future, we could try to make a user interface with button interactions instead of keyboard input. That way the physical effort of choosing and pressing a key, is far less than the physical effort of typing in a given command.
   
   7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
      The size and space for approach and use is not that relevant to our project. That is because our project is a software, so we have no say in which hardware it will be used in. However, from our end, to play our game, you simply need to download our git repo and run SPhase. (???)
   Also, the size of our game does not exceed 10 MB. So it requires very less storage space to be able to run.

3. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
   Since our project is a game, we would promote our program towards the game market. Also, we might see that our HRSimulator might be useful for an HR training system as well: it has potential to simulate real life situations and give feedback as to how one's decision might decide a companies' fate. 

4. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
   As a game, we would love for everyone to play it. However, we acknowledge that this game is quite lenient on text interaction, so those that have trouble reading (Dsylexia) or dislike reading might not find this game as interesting. To solve the problem for those that can't read, we can make the game implement audio and textual recognization. But for those that dislike these types of narrative and dialogue interaction game in general, we would simply have to accept that our game is not that attractive to them.
